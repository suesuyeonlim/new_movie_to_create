# Which movie to create for your new business?
## Overview and Business Understanding
Myclient sees all the big companies creating original video content and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but they do not know anything about creating movies.

In this repository, I explore what types of films are currently doing the best and will in the future. I also give recommendations on whom to hire for the movie, using API data from various movie review websites.

## Data and Analysis
The data used for this analysis are 1) Gross Revenue by movie from [Box Office Mojo](https://www.boxofficemojo.com/) and [The Numbers](https://www.the-numbers.com/); 2) Genre and Runtime information by movie from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/); and 3) Actor/Actresses and Directors information by movie.

The following are the main visualizations of this analysis:

## Conclusion
My final recommendation to the client is to create a multi-genre movie in “Action, Adventure, and Sci-Fi” for which runtime ranges from 120 minutes to 150 minutes. Additionally, the top actors/actresses, along with the directors identified above can be used as the starting point regarding whom to hire for the new movie.
